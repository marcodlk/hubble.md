# HTML Apps use host-injected dependencies

> **Status: accepted.** This ADR is the source of truth for the current [[HTML App]] and [[Embed]] strategy. It supersedes [ADR-0005](./0005-embeds-render-in-realm-shadow-dom.md)'s in-realm Embed Bundle direction for local, agent-authored apps.

Hubble supports folder-local [[HTML App]]s as `.html` files that run in the main content panel. Hubble also supports an inline [[Embed]] form for placing an HTML App inside a [[Markdown File]]:

```html
<iframe src="./file-index.html"></iframe>
```

The HTML file must live inside the open Folder. For an Embed, the iframe `src` must be a folder-local relative `.html` path. Desktop resolves it relative to the Markdown file, serves it through the `hubble-asset://` protocol, and renders it with `sandbox="allow-scripts"` without `allow-same-origin`. The iframe therefore has an opaque origin and cannot reach the host app, Electron preload bridge, local storage, or parent DOM.

## Decisions

- **Load authored HTML by `src`, not `srcdoc`.** Opaque sandboxed `srcdoc` rendered blank in Electron because the child document got a zero layout box on cold start. Loading the workspace file through `hubble-asset://` preserves the opaque sandbox and gives Chromium a normal frame document.
- **Inject dependencies from the host.** Desktop serves Folder `.html` files through `hubble-asset://` after injecting vendorized scripts. Authored HTML should not include dependency `<script>` tags for the Hubble runtime, Tailwind browser, or Alpine.
- **Bundle a canonical dependency set.** The first slice injects Hubble runtime, Tailwind browser v4, and Alpine for every HTML App. There is no opt-in or opt-out yet.
- **The HTML app runtime exposes a small global API.** Today it provides `window.hubble.files.list()`, `window.hubble.files.read()`, `window.hubble.files.open(path, options?)` (with `{ newTab: true }` to open the note in its own tab), `window.hubble.files.create()`, `window.hubble.files.update()`, and `window.hubble.files.remove()`, plus `window.hubble.links.open()` and height reporting over `postMessage` when the HTML App is embedded inline. Each method throws on failure and has a `safe*` variant that returns `{ ok, value | error }`.
- **HTML app link opens go through the existing desktop external-URL path.** The sandbox has no `allow-popups` or `allow-top-navigation`, so apps cannot open URLs themselves. `links.open(url)` forwards over the broker to the same validated `desktop:open-external-url` IPC handler the Markdown editor uses, which only accepts `http(s)` URLs and opens them in the system browser.
- **HTML app file operations are Markdown File operations, not raw filesystem access.** Bare file paths are workspace-relative Markdown paths. Paths beginning with `./` or `../` resolve from the HTML App's folder, including when that app is embedded in a different Markdown File. File results always return canonical workspace-relative paths. `read()` returns `{ path, body, properties }`; `update()` is patch-like and accepts `body`, `properties`, or both. Omitted fields are preserved, and `null` deletes a property key. `create()` fails if the destination already exists. `remove()` prompts for user confirmation before deleting.

## Consequences

- HTML Apps are viewable in a normal browser as static HTML, but Hubble-specific APIs and host-injected dependencies only work when served by Hubble.
- Agents do not need an install step or `.hubble/node_modules` before using Alpine, Tailwind browser classes, or `window.hubble`.
- The Desktop app's bundled runtime dependencies are the portable contract.
- The broker remains async and capability-scoped. Future file APIs should extend the runtime broker rather than exposing direct filesystem access.
